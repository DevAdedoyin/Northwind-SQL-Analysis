## üß† Introduction

The Northwind database is a classic dataset representing a fictional company that imports and exports specialty foods. This project explores various SQL techniques to gain insights into its operations.

---

## üõ† Database Setup

- Ensure you're using a compatible SQL engine (e.g., MySQL or MariaDB).
- Load the Northwind schema and data before running the queries.
- Ensure you have the three `sql` files in this project
